# Armstrong-Number
In simple terms, Armstrong numbers are special because they have a property where the sum of each digit raised to 
the power of the total number of digits in the number equals the number itself. 
they are relatively rare but have an interesting mathematical property that makes them unique.
For example, let's take the number 153:
1. The number of digits in 153 is 3.
2. Each digit (1, 5, and 3) raised to the power of the number of digits (3) and added together: 
   (1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153).
3. As the result (153) is equal to the original number, 153 is an Armstrong number.
